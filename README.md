Current experimental solutions to restoring mobility in physically disabled patients involve deep brain implants that record neural activity from the motor cortex to allow patients to interface with robotic prosthetics. An outstanding issue with this approach is the need for a wired set-up for real-time movement inference. On-chip computation for off-line inference can significantly increase power demands for these implants, necessitating battery replacement surgeries which can increase the risk of complication. Low-power neuromorphic hardware has enabled the potential for portable neural implants by addressing the power demands of on-chip machine learning, although they are incompatible with traditional neural networks. Likewise, a novel approach to motor imagery brain-computer interfaces native to neuromorphic hardware was developed using Spiking Legendre Memory Units and tested on EEG data in the frequency domain.
